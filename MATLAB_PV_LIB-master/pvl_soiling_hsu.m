% Description  
%   [SR]=pvl_soiling_hsu(Time, Rain, RainThresh, Tilt, PM2_5, PM10)
%      Uses the time, rainfall amounts, tilt angle, particulate matter
%      concentrations, and rain cleaning threshold to predict soiling rate
%      using the fixed settling model. Uses hourly rain accumulation to
%      determine cleaning.
%   [SR]=pvl_soiling_hsu(Time, Rain, RainThresh, Tilt, PM2_5, PM10, ModelType)
%      Uses the time, rainfall amounts, tilt angle, particulate matter
%      concentrations, and rain cleaning threshold to predict soiling rate
%      using the model type selected by ModelType. Uses hourly rain
%      accumulation to determine cleaning.
%   [SR]=pvl_soiling_hsu(Time, Rain, RainThresh, Tilt, PM2_5, PM10, ModelType, RainAccPeriod)
%      Uses the time, rainfall amounts, tilt angle, particulate matter
%      concentrations, and rain cleaning threshold to predict soiling rate
%      using the model type selected by ModelType. The user specifies the
%      rain accumulation period (in hours) over which to determine whether
%      sufficient rain has fallen to clean the module.
%   [SR]=pvl_soiling_hsu(Time, Rain, RainThresh, Tilt, PM2_5, PM10, ModelType, RainAccPeriod, LUC, WindSpeed, Temperature)
%      Uses the parameters of the fixed models along with Land Use Category
%      (LUC), wind speed, and ambient temperature to predict soiling ratio
%      using the variable deposition velocity model.
%
% Input Parameters:
%   Time is a struct with elements as described in pvl_maketimestruct. 
%     Time values for the soiling function do not need to be 
%     regularly spaced, although large gaps in timing are discouraged.
%
%   Rain is a vector of rainfall in mm of the same length as Time, where
%     each element of Rain correlates with the element of Time.
%     Rainfall values should be in mm of rainfall. Programmatically, rain
%     is accumulated over a given time period, and cleaning is applied
%     immediately after a time period where the cleaning threshold is
%     reached.
%
%   RainThresh is a scalar for the amount of rain, in mm, in an accumulation
%     period needed to clean the PV modules. In periods where the 
%     accumulated rain meets or exceeds RainThresh, the panels are assumed 
%     to be cleaned immediately after the accumulation period 
%     [1] suggests a good RainThresh could be 1mm, but the time period is
%     not specified. Rain accumulation period length can be adjusted in the
%     optional input RainAccPeriod.
%
%   Tilt is a scalar or vector for the tilt of the PV panels. Changing tilt
%     angles (e.g. in tracking cases) can be accomodated, and tilt angles
%     are correlated with the entries in Time.
%
%   PM2_5 is the concentration of airborne particulate matter (PM) with diameter less 
%     than 2.5 microns, in g/m^3. Historical US concentration data sets may be
%     found at https://aws.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html. With
%     file descriptions (for hourly data sets) at 
%     https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/FileFormats.html#_hourly_data_files
%   
%   PM10 is the concentration of airborne particulate matter (PM) with diameter less than
%     10 microns, in g/m^3. Historical US PM data sets found as described
%     above.
%
%   ModelType is an optional input to the function to determine the 
%     the model type to be used in the soiling model, see [1]. A
%     value of "1" indicates that the Variable Deposition Velocity model
%     shall be used, a value of "2" indicates that the Fixed Settling
%     Velocity model shall be used, and a value of "3" indicates that the
%     Fixed Deposition Velocity model shall be used. [1] indicates that the
%     Fixed Settling Velocity model performs best under a wide range of
%     conditions, and thus "2" is the default ModelType if ModelType is omitted. 
%     Validation efforts by Sandia National Laboratories
%     confirm these findings. If an incorrect ModelType is provided, the
%     Fixed Settling Velocity (type 2) will be used (with a warning).
%
%   RainAccPeriod is an optional input that specifies the period, in hours,
%     over which to accumulate rainfall totals before checking against the
%     rain cleaning threshold. For example, if the rain threshold is
%     0.5 mm per hour, then RainThresh should be 0.5 and RainAccPeriod
%     should be 1. If the threshold is 1 mm per hour, then the values
%     should be 1 and 1, respectively. The minimum RainAccPeriod is 1
%     hour. The default value is 1, indicating hourly rain accumulation.
%     Accumulation periods exceeding 24 (daily accumulation) are not
%     recommended.
%   
%   LUC is an optional input to the function, but it is required for the
%     Variable Deposition Model. LUC is the Land Use Category as specified
%     in Table 19.2 of [2]. LUC must be a numeric scalar with value 1, 4,
%     6, 8, or 10, corresponding to land with evergreen trees, deciduous
%     trees, grass, desert, or shrubs with interrupted woodlands. If 
%     omitted, the default value of 8 (desert) is used. 
%
%   WindSpeed is an optional input to the function, but is required for the
%     Variable Deposition Model. WindSpeed is a scalar or vector value with
%     the same number of elements as Time, and must be in meters per
%     second. If WindSpeed is omitted, the value of 2 m/s is used as
%     default.
%
%   Temperature is an optional input to the function, but is required for
%     the Variable Deposition Model. Temperature is a scalar or vector
%     value with the same number of Elements as Time and must be in degrees
%     C. If Temperature is omitted, the value of 12 C is used as default.
% 
% 
% Output Parameters:
%   SR = The soiling ratio (SR) of a tilted PV panel, this is a number
%   between 0 and 1. SR is a time series where each element of SR
%   correlates with the accumulated soiling and rain cleaning at the times
%   specified in Time.
%
% Background and recognition:
%   This soiling model was developed by Liza Boyle and Merissa Coello at
%   Humboldt State University (HSU). Many thanks to Liza and Merissa for
%   model development, initial code, and subsequent code and performance
%   reviews.

% the rain meets or exceeds the stated thresshold. Note that this means
% that the mass will never be reported as zero because the cleaning is
% applied immediately after a time step, and new mass accumulates between
% the cleaning and the first time reported after the cleaning.
% Note that this could be done more clearly by going through each time step
% and accumulating or clearing based on daily rainfall, but this is much
% faster, and can utilize trapezoidal soiling integration.
